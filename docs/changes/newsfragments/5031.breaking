The default configuration of QCoDeS dataset ``GUID_components.GUID_type`` has changed from ``explicit_sample`` to ``random_sample``.
This means that QCoDeS GUIDs will no longer start with ``aaaaaaaa`` but with a random string. This significantly reduces the risk
of duplicate GUIDs.
This also means that that the ability to set a sample_id as part of the dataset GUID is disabled by default. With
the default config its therefor an error to set ``GUID_components.sample`` to anything but the default value. The original
behavior can be restored by setting ``GUID_components.GUID_type`` to ``explicit_sample`` in the config file but is not recommended.
Users should make use of the ``sample_name`` attached to an experiment as an alternative. Note that if you have already created
a local config you will need to update this for the changes to take effect.
